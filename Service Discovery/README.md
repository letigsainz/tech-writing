# Service Discovery: Register your service with Consul

## Context

During my time on the developer productivity team, I helped architect and implement a service discovery tool (Consul) into the engineering org's broader architecture. This tool enabled all internal services to communicate with one another in a secure, reliable, scalable, and - most importantly - automatic way.

This document was written to guide developers through the set up process. I.e. it taught developers how to register their services with the service discovery tool.

## Impact

This document gave developers across the engineering organization the guidance and autonomy to enable service discovery for their team's services, thereby removing any need for manual network address and load balancing configuration. 

As a result, developers could use their time more productively on other tasks.
