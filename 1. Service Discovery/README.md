# Service Discovery: Register your service with Consul

## Context

During my time on the developer productivity team, I helped architect and build a service discovery solution (Consul) into the company's underlying architecture. This tool enabled all internal services (AWS ECS, Lambda) to communicate with one another in a secure, reliable, scalable, and - most importantly - automatic way.

## Impact

This document gave developers across the engineering organization the guidance and autonomy to enable service discovery for their team's services, thereby removing any need for manual network address and load balancing configuration. 

As a result, developers could spend their time more productively on other tasks.
