# Python M2M Library

## Context

During my time on the developer productivity team, I helped create a python3 library to handle machine to machine authentication for internal services.

## Impact

This document served as an informative reference guide for developers using machine to machine requests in their services. Additional documents were created alongside this guide, but I cannot include them due to proprietary content. Because of this, any external links will go nowhere.

## Link to document

**Note**: Due to proprietary content, all external links have been modified to go nowhere.
